            <p>Li Fei-Fei was born in Beijing, China, in October 1976. Growing up in a period of significant socio-economic change in China, Li was influenced by her academic surroundings; her father was a physics professor, and her mother worked as a nurse. From a young age, Li's family emphasized the importance of education, fostering her early interest in science and technology.</p>
            
            <p>At 16, Li and her family emigrated to the United States, settling in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey. The transition to a new country brought numerous challenges, including cultural adaptation and overcoming the language barrier. Enrolled in Parsippany High School, Li initially struggled with English and was placed in an ESL (English as a Second Language) program. Despite these hurdles, her determination and academic prowess shone through as she quickly adapted and excelled in her studies.</p>
